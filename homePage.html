              <p>In 1981 Herbs released their first EP ‘What’s be Happen?’ which was a response and a protest to many political events that happened in New Zealand in the 70s and early 80s. The most notable and influential events include the occupation of Bastion Point, the dawn raids of suspected over stayers, and the protests of the 1981 Springbok tour. In the album, they focus on issues of racism and discrimination as these were the controversial topics that were increasingly relevant at that time.

              Over 506 days during 1977 and 1978, Maori people and supporters occupied Bastion point in protest of the land being taken from local iwi. The peaceful protest began two days before construction was set to begin, as the government was trying to sell what little was left of the Maori land. On the 25th of May 1978, police and military were sent to forcibly remove the protesters and destroy the makeshift homes they had lived in for the last year (Govt.nz, 2016). Activist groups such as Nga Tamatoa supported the protesters as well as being some of the first to bring up the Treaty of Waitangi in regards to ownership of Maori land. They first staged a protest in 1974 against the celebrations of Waitangi Day, and this became an annual protest. The largest was in 1984 with around 4,000 people marching from Ngaruawahia to Waitiangi (Keane, 2012). The amount of support for the protests show how widely these feelings of loss and injustice are felt throughout New Zealanders. This is reflected in Herbs’ album ‘What’s be Happen?’. Maybe the most obvious reference to the taking of Maori land in their 1981 album is the image used as the cover; an aerial photograph of the protesters being evicted from Bastion Point back in 1978. The lyrics in the song ‘One Brotherhood’ directly reference the taking of Maori land “Well they're fighting for land in Raglan, And they're fighting for land in Orakei”. They also sing about the unity felt by the Maori people “together we'll stand, together we have power”. As the band have Maori members, the topic of land being taken would be felt as an important issue for them.

              Although New Zealand is thought to have good race relations, there is a very dark part of our history where people were targeted based on race. In the 1960s during the economic boom, Pacific Islanders were encouraged to come to New Zealand to provide cheap labour. Then in the 70s when unemployment levels were high, illegal over stayers were seen as the problem which had to be removed. This idea lead to the dawn raids which began in 1973. Police squads would raid the homes or workplaces of Polynesians that they believed to be over stayers, often at dawn. Polynesians made up 86% of the arrests and prosecutions of the dawn raids, yet they made up only a third of the over stayers in New Zealand, with the majority from Britain, Australia and South Africa (NZs dawn raid history, n.d.). The track ‘What’s Be Happen?’ uses Cook Island log drums and has lines in Maori, Tongan and Samoan. The lyrics ‘What’s be happen, when the children turn away, and why for you stay when nothing remains, and why for you laugh when I long for home?’ describe the long-lasting pain of getting removed from the country. The use of different languages and cultural instruments reflect the unity between the band members and the Polynesian communities they belong to. Since the band is made up of Maori, Fijian and Tongan members, events surrounding the treatment of Polynesians in New Zealand were especially important to them.
              </p>
              <p>
              As well as the raids, racial profiling and harassment by police became a major problem for Pacific Islanders around this time. The Polynesian Panthers formed 1971 to seek more fair treatment for Polynesians living in New Zealand. The Panthers targeted issues such as poor work and living conditions, police harassment, and of course stopping the dawn raids (Reid, 2010). The song ‘Whistling in the dark’ describes policemen targeting Islanders and using extreme treatment; “I was minding my own, floating so free, Carload of D’s pull me up I & D (What’s your name boy?), they put me in chains and they asked me my name, they kept me all night ignored all my rights”. The way they sing about these things happening implies they have experienced this kind of unfair treatment themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
              In 1981, the same year as the release of the ‘What’s be happen?’ album, the South African national rugby team were set to tour New Zealand. But this was at the time of the apartheid, and the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement discouraged competition and contact with South Africa. New Zealanders protested the tour as they felt engaging in sporting competitions with the country condoned the apartheid, and reflected on how New Zealand viewed their own race relations (Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2014). As the tour went ahead, many protests ended in violence and chaos. The song ‘Azania’ on the Herbs album is about the racism in South Africa and the activists that were central in the fight for freedom. The word “Azania” itself is an ancient name used by anti-apartheid groups, so it is clear that they are taking a political stance with the song (Reid G. , n.d.). The words “Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Azania” are chanted in multiple voices with increasing urgency, as if to mimic the protests of the Springbok tour (Turner, 2012).

              The Herbs album uses political terminology and directly referenced lyrics to describe the issues going on in both New Zealand and internationally. The use of voices and instruments in their songs give a sense of unity between oppressed groups, whether by race or otherwise. The message that the band sends with the album is to always fight for your rights and don’t be held down by those in power.
